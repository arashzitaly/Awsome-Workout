#INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, taking care of your body and your health is more important than everything. The
motivation to schedule exercises and drag yourself into the class can be lacking at times.
Working out at home is a convenient and cost-effective alternative to going to the gym.
Nothing beats having a personal trainer to guide you to your fitness goal. You‘ll be motivated to work
harder, You‘ll have a teacher to make sure you are working in the right way, and you‘ll have a financial
incentive to show up because the private sessions are usually far from cheap.
However, planning all your workouts can be challenging even for the biggest gym buffs. That’s where
personal trainer apps come in handy, as they make it easy to enjoy high-quality workouts almost
everywhere. Guided meditation is also available in the application to help the user practice
mindfulness and improve your overall wellbeing.
The aim of this application is to make your lifestyle healthier by tracking your movement and physical
activities and meditation. It can even track your food intake and water on your eating pattern.
